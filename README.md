# TFL Tube Status App - 3 day project
The idea of this project is to use the TFL api to create a deployed website that reflects the current status of each tube line.

## User stories
- As a user, I should be able to see a quick summary of what the status for all the lines of the tube
- As a user, I should be able to click on a specific line to see further information about a line

### To be implemented
- As a user, I should be able to see other information such as whether a line has Night tube service or not
- As a user, I should be able to see a timestamp for when the information being displayed has last been updated
- As a user, I should be able to see other information such as congestion
